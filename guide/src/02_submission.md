# Submission

To submit your solution, please create a fork of this repository and submit a pull request to the
`main` branch. Your pull request should include the following:

- A new directory in the `solutions` directory named after your GitHub username.
- This should contain a binary rust project with your solution.
- The binary should accept a single argument, that is the file path to the input file.

For example, if your GitHub username is `sassman`, your solution should be in `solutions/sassman`.
It should be callable like this:

```sh
cd solutions/sassman
cargo run --release -- ../../samples/weather_100.csv
```

The output should be written to stdout.

Please note that CI will run on your pull request to ensure that your solution compiles and runs
correctly.

:NOTE: If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the
[`#hack-evening-2024-4` channel on the Rust Munich Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/704612189532586014/1315802468868817007).

Good luck! ðŸ¦€

## CI is your friend

- Your PR is automatically checked by GitHub Actions
- Benchmarks are exectued and results are provided as Comment on the PR, you can use this as a tool
- Flamegraphs are also produced during the build, they should appear on the PR as comment as well

## Submission Evaluation

We are evaluating submissions by benchmarking them on a set of three self-hosted Github runners with
dedicated vCPU cores. The servers are AMD EPYC instances (CCX33) from
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) with the following specs:

| resource             | value |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| dedicated vCPU cores | 8     |
| RAM in GB            | 32    |
| disk space in GB     | 240   |

You submission will be terminated after 8 minutes (including build time).
